## [v0.59.1]

> Release date: 2024/09/12
- fix: Prevent unset records to be filled with empty tables: {}
  for deck files.
  [#467](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/467)

## [v0.59.0]

> Release date: 2024/09/04
- Enhance the utils `FillPluginsDefaults*` functions to allow individually 
  selecting whether to fill normal and auto fields with default values.
  [#466](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/466)

## [v0.58.0]

> Release date: 2024/08/29

- When fields marked as auto are passed to kong without a value they 
  are auto generated by the gateway. In that case, comparing with "defaults" 
  doesn't work, so in order to compute a correct diff they must be copied 
  from Kong's configuration. This change adds a new `FillPluginsDefaultsAutoFields`
  utils function that in addition to default fields, adds auto fields to the 
  configuration. It takes an additional parameter: oldPlugin, which represents 
  the plugin as defined in the config from Kong: auto fields are copied from it 
  so that they don't show up in the diff.
  [#465](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/465)

## [v0.57.1]

> Release date: 2024/08/05

- Fill default values for shorthand_fields in plugin configuration. 
  If values are passed for shorthand_fields, they are retained and 
  nested configuration is backfilled with shorthand_field values. 
  [#458](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/458)

## [v0.57.0]

> Release date: 2024/06/25

- **Breaking change** `ReloadDeclarativeRawConfig` now doesn't return a response body
  as its first return value - the body can be obtained from `APIError` returned when
  the response is not successful.
  [#453](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/453)

## [v0.56.0]

> Release date: 2024/06/25

- `ReloadDeclarativeRawConfig` now returns `APIError` when it retrieves a valid 
  HTTP response, allowing inspection of the response status code.
  [#452](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/452)

## [v0.55.0]

> Release date: 2024/05/14

- Add `Validate` method in `SchemaService` to validate arbitrary type of Kong
  entities.
  [#443](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/443)

## [v0.54.0]

> Release date: 2024/04/03

- Allow overriding Client request dispatch function.
  [#430](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/430)

## [v0.53.0]

> Release date: 

- Support record-level default schema values.
  [#431](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/431)

## [v0.52.0]

> Release date: 2024/03/26

- Allow configuration of `User-Agent` for the client.
  [#427](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/427)

## [v0.51.0]

> Release date: 2024/01/23

- Added extract of `details` field in response when CRUD API fails to extract
  details from Konnect APIs.
  [#399](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/399)

## [v0.50.0]

> Release date: 2024/01/09

- Added `workspace` parameter to `FillID` method of entities to avoid entities
  with same key in different workspaces to have the same ID, which is unique
  cross all workspaces.
  [#395](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/395)

## [v0.49.0]

> Release date: 2024/01/04

- Added `Validate` method in vault service to validate vaults.
  [#392](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/392)
- Added `FillID()` method for vault.
  [#391](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/391)

## [v0.48.0]

> Release date: 2023/10/30

- `Route`'s `priority` field type is changed from `int` to `uint64`.
  [#378](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/378)
- Fix a bug preventing users to set fields to empty arrays when
  a default for those fields exist.
  [#374](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/374)

## [v0.47.0]

> Release date: 2023/08/29

- Added method `Validate` to `RouteService`
  [#368](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/368)

## [v0.46.0]

> Release date: 2023/07/17

- Added method `FillID()` method for Consumer Group.
  [#357](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/357)
- Added support for scoping plugins to Consumer Groups.
  [#352](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/352)

## [v0.45.0]

> Release date: 2023/07/03

- Added `Client.Config` handler, that can be used to obtain Kong's config.
  [#354](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/354)

## [v0.44.0]

> Release date: 2023/06/22

- Fix: handle empty array as nil when filling record defaults
  [#345](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/345)
- Fix leaking response body from `Client.Do()`. From now on `kong.Response` does
  not contain the `http.Response` field which was in fact leaking the implementation
  detail. It now contains the response headers, status and status code.
  If users want to get the response body they can still provide the `v` parameter
  to `Do()` to get the body unmarshalled into it (or copied into it if an `io.Writer`
  was to be provided).
  [#348](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/348)

## [v0.43.0]

> Release date: 2023/06/06

- Added missing `use_srv_name` and `healthchecks.active.headers` to `Upstream`
  entity.
  [#331](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/331)
- Fix regressions when filling defaults for set and record schema types.
  [#333](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/333)
  [#336](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/336)

## [v0.42.0]

> Release date: 2023/05/15

- Added `Details` and `SetDetails` methods to `APIError` struct to enable
  propagating status-specific details in there.
  Introduced `ErrTooManyRequestsDetails` struct that's going to be available
  as an `APIError`'s `Details` when Admin API returns status code 429 along
  with a `Retry-After` header. That should be useful for handling rate limiting
  on an application level.
  [#323](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/323)
- Use modern schema retrieval function for plugin schema retrieval. This
  provides compatibility with upcoming Kong releases.
  [#326](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/326)

## [v0.41.0]

> Release date: 2023/04/25

- Added `FillID` method for `Service`, `Route` and `Consumer` entities. It allows
  setting a deterministic ID to an entity.
  [#299](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/299)

## [v0.40.0]

> Release date: 2023/04/07

- Added support for the `/licenses` endpoint.
  [#304](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/304)

## [v0.39.2]

> Release date: 2023/04/05

This release reverts the fix from 0.39.1 while debugging [an
issue](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/issues/307) not originally caught in
tests.

## [v0.39.1]

> Release date: 2023/04/04

- fix: default population now correctly handles arrays of records.
  [#302](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/302)

## [v0.39.0]

> Release date: 2023/03/17

- feat: add GraphQL-RateLimiting-Advanced and DeGraphQL DAOs (#288)
  [#288](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/288)

## [v0.38.1]

> Release date: 2023/02/22

- Omit response body from error when config push fails. The body can be quite
  large and will result in massive logs downstream if included in the error.
  The body is returned along with the error and downstream clients and log it
  separately if they so desire.

## [v0.38.0]

> Release date: 2023/02/13

- Added `instance_name` to Plugin schema.
  [#280](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/280)

## [v0.37.0]

> Release date: 2023/02/03

- **Breaking change:** the `ConfigService` is now directly embedded in the
  `kong.Client`. Configurations are collections of entities, not entities
  themselves, so they do not fit with other go-kong services.
- **Breaking change:** `ReloadDeclarativeRawConfig()` (formerly part of
  `ConfigService`, now part of `kong.Client`) now has the response signature
  `([]byte, error)` instead of `error`. The byte slice is the config response
  body. The error is unchanged.
- **Breaking change:** `ReloadDeclarativeRawConfig()` now requires a
  `flattenErrors` boolean argument. When `true`, requests will include
  `flatten_errors=1` in the query string, to activate the functionality added
  in <https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/10161>.
  [#273](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/273)

## [v0.36.0]

> Release date: 2023/01/24

- Added `NewAPIErrorWithRaw()` to return a go-kong APIError along with the original raw error body.
  [#237](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/237)
  [#267](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/267)

## [v0.35.0]

> Release date: 2023/01/19

- Add consumer_groups tags support
  [#265](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/265)
- Add IsForbiddenErr error checking for 403s
  [#264](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/264)

## [v0.34.1]

> Release date: 2022/12/22

- Fix ingestion of entity defaults with arbitray map values
  [#258](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/258)

- Add possibility to client to send declarative configs via `ReloadDeclarativeRawConfig()`
  [#252](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/252)
- Add OAuth2 client_type field
  [#235](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/235)
- Fix ingestion of entity defaults with map values
  [#244](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/244)
- Add support to filling entity defaults using JSON schemas.
  [#231](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/231)

## [v0.33.0]

> Release date: 2022/10/05

- Add support to Kong Vaults
  [#224](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/224)
- Add plugin to a route
  [#217](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/217)

## [v0.32.0]

> Release date: 2022/08/23

This release is not yet fully compatible with Kong 3.x. The target service `MarkHealthy()` and `MarkUnhealthy()`
functions do not yet work on 3.x. Other functionality supports 3.x, but may not yet support all new 3.x schema fields.

- Added support for 3.x Enterprise version strings.
  [#207](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/207)
- Added support for `expression` and `priority` route fields.
  [#210](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/210)
- Dropped support for 1.5 Enterprise, which exited sunset support in 2022-04.

  `/service/<id>/plugins/` endpoints.
  [#192](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/192)
- Added support for Kong 3.0 upstream fields.
  [#200](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/200)

## [v0.30.0]

> Release date: 2022/07/11

- Updated to Go 1.18.
  [#164](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/164)
- Fixed an issue with the HTTP client wrapper not setting any transport when
  none was configured. It now uses the default transport.
  [#179](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/179)
- Added support for the new `ordering` field on Enterprise 3.x plugins.
  [#187](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/187)

## [v0.29.0]

> Release date: 2022/03/25

- Fixed a bug where `HTTPClientWithHeaders()` could not accept a `nil`
  (default) client.
  [#138](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/138)
- Fixed a bug where the plugin service's `Validate()` method could not handle
  errors associated with empty responses.
  [#142](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/142)
- Fixed a bug where plugin schema default retrieval included fields outside the
  plugin's `config` object.
  [#145](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/145)

- Fixed a bug with RBAC endpoint permission path construction.
  [#148](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/148)

## [v0.28.1]

> Release date: 2022/02/22

- Export the `requiredFeatures` struct to be able to use `RunWhenEnterprise()`
  in other packages.
  [#135](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/135)

## [v0.28.0]

> Release date: 2022/02/14

- The `RunWhenKong()` and `RunWhenEnterprise()` functions are now exported for
  other packages that need to condition tests on Kong versions.
  [#132](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/132)
- RBAC permission actions are now an array of strings rather than a single
  comma-separated string to properly reflect their Kong type.
  [#131](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/132)
- Enterprise versions returned by `ParseSemanticVersion()` now include their
  supplemental Enterprise version as build info, rather than as a prerelease.
  This fixes an issue where semver comparisons saw the initial patch of a minor
  release as a lower version of that release.
  [#129](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/129)

## [v0.27.0]

> Release date: 2022/02/03

- Zero values (boolean `false` and integer `0`) now override default values
  when filling entity defaults.
  [#125](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/125)

## [v0.26.0]

> Release date: 2022/01/31

- Add missing entity fields from newer Kong releases.
  [#120](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/120)
- Add `SchemaService` and `FillEntityDefaults` utility supporting
  filling defaults for Services, Routes, Upstream and Targets.
  [#119](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/119)
- Add `GetFullSchema` to plugins to retrieve their complete schema.
  Also add `FillPluginsDefaults` utility to fill a plugin with its defaults.
  [#114](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/114)

## [v0.25.1]

> Release date: 2021/12/08

v0.25.1 reverts the k8s.io/code-generator version originally used in v0.25.0 to
avoid an unwanted upgrade of its github.com/go-logr/logr dependency.

## [v0.25.0]

> Release date: 2021/12/08

- Healthcheck types now include CRD validation annotations for
  [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers/crd-validation.html).
  [#104](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/104)

## [v0.24.0]

> Release date: 2021/11/05

### Added

- A `Listeners()` method was added to the Kong `Client` in order to retrieve
  the `proxy_listeners` and `stream_listeners` from the root conveniently.
  [#101](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/101)

## [v0.23.0]

> Release date: 2021/09/22

### Breaking changes

- The plugin service `Validate()` API's return signature is now `bool, string,
  err` rather than `bool, err`. The additional string value contains the
  validation failure reason if validation successfully determined that the
  proposed configuration was not valid. The err value is now only set if
  `Validate()` could not successfully retrieve validation information because
  of a timeout/DNS lookup failure/etc.

## [v0.22.0]

> Release date: 2021/09/22

### Added

- Test that target updates work as expected.
  [#85](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/85)
- Workspace service supports new `ExistsByName()` API. This is similar to
  `Exists()`, but it only accepts names, not IDs. This function can check if a
  workspace exists even if the RBAC user has access to that namespace only.
  `Exists()` requires access to the default namespace.
  [#90](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/90)

### Fixed

- The generic `exists()` client functions uses GETs instead of HEADs. Kong
  <=2.6 respond to HEAD requests with 200s as long as the endpoint has a valid
  form. They do not check if entities actually exist, and `exists()` would
  return true for entities that don't exist because of this.
  [#90](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/90)

## [v0.21.0]

> Release date: 2021/08/26

### Added

- oauth2 entities support `hash_secret`.
  [#74](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/74)

### Fixed

- Plugin validation checks against the correct status code.
  [#81](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/81)

## [v0.20.0]

> Release date: 2021/07/07

### Added

- FriendlyName is now defined for entities based on deck types.
  [#68](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/68)
- Added Info service for interacting with information exposed by the admin API root endpoint.
  [#65](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/65)
- Implemented client-level support for Kong workspaces.
  [#62](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/62)

### Changed

- Internally wrapped errors now use the standard Go library instead of a 3rd party
  wrapping lib and consequently several string versions of errors have changed.
  [#66](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/66)
- Various improvements to repository CI: caching go modules, updating codegen, e.t.c.

## [v0.19.0]

> Release date: 2021/05/05

### Added

- Client now allows reading the version of Kong. [#48](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/48)

## [v0.18.0]

> Release date: 2021/05/05

### Added

- Workspace and tag existence functions. [#56](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/56)
- Plugin schema retrieval. [#57](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/57)

### Changed

- The default client now sets a default timeout. [#51](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/51)
- Optimized HTTP header handling. [#49](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/49)
- Changed return type of `kong.HTTPClientWithHeaders(...)`: now returns `*http.Client` instead of `http.Client`. [#46](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/46)
- Now uses Go 1.16 module semantics. [#40](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/40)
- Now uses Dependabot to manage GitHub Actions. [#41](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/41), [#42](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/42)
- Now uses code-generator v0.21.0. [#43](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/43)
- CI no longer uses Bintray repositories. [#55](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/55)
- Dropped testing against older versions of Kong. [#58](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/58)

## [v0.17.0]

> Release date: 2021/04/05

### Added

- Added support for Developer entities. Thanks to @ChristianJacquot!
  [#27](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/27)
- Added support for Developer Role entities. Thanks to @mmorel-35!
  [#30](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/27)
- RBAC roles now support pagination and listing all entities. Thanks to
  @mmorel-35!
  [#30](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/27)
- Tests can now require the Portal. Added helpers to enable the Portal and
  related settings.
  [#30](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/27)
